## Drone Flight Dataset with AI integration

I developed a responsive user interface that enables users to input and retrieve drone flight information. By integrating an AI client powered by OpenAI, this app can process natural language queries, as it has been trained on multiple drone flight datasets. Each dataset corresponds to an image captured during a drone flight. The LLM is provided with a drone flight dataset as input to generate responses.
